Stand Alone Main Control Case with Modular Mounts for Various Mainboards, Display's, RPi's, Fans amd MORE!

Summary

I designed this Control Box out of the need for one. All the cases I found were specific to one machine and one mainboard. So if I wanted to change the mainboard or modify the machine design it quickly became obsolete. My idea behind this one is to print it once and be able to make changes as I need them. Change the screen, mainboard or RPi, just print a new mount, install it and continue. I don't have to reprint the entire thing.

The component mounts are removable and changeable so it is very versatile. I currently have plans to put this on 4 printers so the design will change from time to time. Hopefully getting better each time, so add this to your watch list. I have included mounts for the SKR mainboard's, RP3 and 4, and displays that i have and can verify fit. If I don't have it listed yet then it isnt quite ready, Sorry.
